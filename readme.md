1. Open https://music.youtube.com/library/uploaded_albums or https://music.youtube.com/library/uploaded_songs
2. Open Developer Console panel (F12)

Delete by album is faster in most cases where one album contains several songs to be deleted at once.

Songs without album tag would not appear on uploaded album page. In this case, you need to go to uploaded song page and run the script there.
